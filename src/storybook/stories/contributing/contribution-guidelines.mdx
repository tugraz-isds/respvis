# Contribution Guidelines

- allways same version number for all packages. raise version and publish at same time
- \import \export policy (do \export type etc., package export policy)
- stick to package structure / project structure
- how to include data
- naming conventions
- examples self-contained



## Generated Files and Directories

Generated files and folder are not meant to be pushed to the repository,
and must, therefore, be included in the .gitignore. Keeping this in mind
is important as gulp generates many files in the build step.


## Adding Self-Contained Examples

When adding a new self-contained example or data, it is important to
update the Paths](gulp-tasks/paths.js) and
[Path Mappings](gulp-tasks/copy-example-dependencies/copyPathData.js)
accordingly. These are part of the [subtasks](gulp-tasks) of gulp.
Changes to the subtasks will influence which files are generated by gulp
and where.
