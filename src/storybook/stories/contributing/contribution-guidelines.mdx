# Contribution Guidelines



## Project Structure

RespVis has a designated way of adding new functionality or
chart examples. To maintain a clear, understandable structure,
it is important to stick to the
[existing structures](?path=/docs/contributing-project-structure--docs#gulp-tasks-directory).



## Releasing

When doing a release, make sure to follow these steps:
- Check that the current branch is develop.
- Raise the version of all package.jsons.
  They all must be the same.
- Raise the version of all package.jsons peer-dependencies.
  They all must be the same.
- Make sure that all packages follow the import/export policy.
- Add release commit in develop and merge to master.
- Check that the current branch is now master.
- Create a new tag. It must be named to: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
  and must match with the versions of the package.jsons.
- Push the created tag.
- Publish all packages on the public npm registry (make sure working
  directory is project root).
  Use `npm publish --dry-run` for testing.
  Use `npm publish --workspaces` for publishing all sub packages at once.
  Use `npm publish` for publishing extensive package.
- Create a release from the new tag on GitHub.
- Add the self-contained RespVis bundle as package.zip to release files
  (include respvis.js, respvis.js.map, respvis.min.js, respvis.min.js.map,
  respvis.css, respvis.d.ts).



## Importing/Exporting



### Importing/Exporting TypeScript on Bundling

Keeping to RespVis' import/export policy is an important matter
because it greatly influences the bundle process.
To understand the bundle process, one must know that each subpackage
of the RespVis library has an entry file named `index.ts`. The bundler
will check everything which is exported from this entry file and include
it in the final bundle.
To gain more fine-grained control, additional `index.ts` files exist for all
nested directories. A top-level `index.ts` exports all its nested `index.ts`.
This way, the entry file will export all desired functionality.

Importing functionality from one RespVis package to another requires a special
strategy. This is because if relative paths were used, the bundler
would include the code from the providing package also in the dependent package.
RespVis makes use of path aliases defined in the `tsconfig.json` to avoid this
form of double bundling and enable importing functionality between subpackages.


### Importing/Exporting Policy for TypeScript

Importing and exporting is applied in several different ways in RespVis.
To give a good explanation, respvis-bar and respvis-core are taken as
reference examples, but they can be substituted with the other packages:
  1. A file in respvis-core imports from another file in respvis-core.
  It is advisable to use relative path imports hereby as using the path
  alias may lead to problems and slowdowns in the bundling process.
  2. A file in respvis-bar imports functionality from respvis-core. For this
  case an import must be declared via path alias:
  `import {<functionality>} from 'respvis-core'`. This way, rollup will
  recognize that the import comes from an external package and will
  specify so in the generated bundle.
  3. An `index.ts` reexports a named type of a file.
  For this case it is not enough to export like this:
  `export {<type-name>} from "<path-to-file>"`,
  but one must use type-only exports:
  `export type {<type-name>} from "<path-to-file>"`. The
  reason is that the live docs use vite as bundler and
  the transpile process has different requirements.



### Importing Policy for CSS

The bundling process for CSS works similar like for TypeScript,
but is less complicated because there is no need to import dependencies
and all CSS files must be included in the bundle. Each package contains
a corresponding entry `index.css`. Other CSS files can be imported using
import statements: `@import '<relative-path>';`. In the build step, gulp
takes care of substituting import statements with the real CSS code and
generating a single CSS files which is included in the generated package
directory.



## Naming Conventions

Entities in RespVis are named such that composed names sound
natural and follow the conventions of the English language.
Functions and methods start with a verb indicating the performed
action.



### Casing Entities

The case conventions for entities in RespVis are:
- Files: `<kebap-case-file>.<extension>`
- Directories:`<kebap-case-directory>`
- Functions:`camelCaseFunction()`
- Classes: `PascalCaseClass`
- Types: `PascalCaseType`



### Semantic Naming Conventions

RespVis' API is designed to let a user create
visualisations by providing one JavaScript object containing numerous
properties and nested objects. All these entities are validated before
being used in the rendering process. Three types must be provided to
achieve a clean validation process:
- UserArgsType: This type will be visible by the end user when creating
  a visualisation. It supports the user by providing information about
  the expected arguments.
- ArgsType: This type extends the UserArgsType by including properties
  which the user should not care about but must be provided internally
  to create a valid data object.
- DataType: The valid data object which is returned by the validation
  function. This type can be reliably used for internal data operations.

A good example for this type and name convention is the validation of
the base arguments necessary for creating all types of chart:

<Source code={validateChart} language='typescript'/>


## Generated Files and Directories

Generated files and folder are not meant to be pushed to the repository,
and must, therefore, be included in the .gitignore. Keeping this in mind
is important as gulp generates many files in the build step.
