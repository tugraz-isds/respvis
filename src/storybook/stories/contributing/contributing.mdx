# Documentation And Testing

The famous frontend workshop Storybook is used to provide extensive
documentation about RespVis. When running storybook one can conveniently
navigate through different use cases of different RespVis components. On
top of that there are many markdown files explaining the functionality of
RespVis in depth. To run storybook one must execute the following command:

```
npm run storybook
```

# Workflow

All the RespVis [examples](src/examples) are fully self-contained.
All the files necessary for serving each example chart are included
in its folder after building in the dist folder.

The folder [src/examples-dependencies](src/examples-dependencies)
holds dependencies which could be of interest for all examples, for
example, datasets, default styles, and library bundles. When the
build task is executed, all necessary files are copied into the right
place for the examples in the dist folder.

Generated files are not meant to be pushed to the repository, and
are therefore included in the .gitignore file. When adding new chart
examples or data it is important to keep this in mind and update the
[Paths](gulp-tasks/paths.js) and [Path
Mappings](gulp-tasks/copy-example-dependencies/copyPathData.js) accordingly. These are part of
the [subtasks](gulp-tasks) of gulp. Changes to the subtasks will
influence which files are generated by gulp and where.


## Deployment

There are several ways to try out a built version of
the RespVis examples:

- Copy the `dist` folder to a web server's webspace.

- Start a local web server in the `dist` folder with a command like:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
and point a web browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

- Open the `dist/index.html` file directly in a browser (make
sure your browser CORS policy [allows local file
requests](https://dev.to/dengel29/loading-local-files-in-firefox-and-chrome-m9f)).
