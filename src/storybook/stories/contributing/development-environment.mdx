# Development Environment


## Installing

The library is built on the Node ecosystem. Before attempting to do
anything else, all the dependencies need to be installed at the root
directory of the repository:

```
npm install
```



## Gulp Tasks

Gulp is used to automate repeatable tasks. The file gulpfile.ts, which is
located at the root directory, defines six public tasks:

- The `clean` task removes existing `package` and `dist` directories to
  enable a clean rebuild of the project.

- The `cleanExampleDeps` task removes generated dependencies from the
  `/src/examples/**` directory.

- The `cleanAll` task executes the `clean` task, `cleanExampleDeps` task
  and additionally removes the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json`
  in order to enable a clean rebuild of the project including the
  re-installation of dependencies.

- The `build` task first executes the clean task, then builds the
  whole library and copies the self-contained examples into
  the freshly created `dist` folder. The build task, unlike the serve
  task, bundles all packages contained by RespVis. It is also responsible
  for generating necessary dependencies into `/src/examples/**`.
  It would be not sufficient to generate them in `/dist`, due to otherwise
  missing files in the source folder, which would lead to countless errors.

- The `serve` task first executes the build task, but only generates the
  package at root level to save time on rebuilds. It additionally
  executes a private task called watcher which has two
  responsibilities: First, the browser-sync package is used to
  initialise a live server serving the `dist` directory. Then,
  file watchers are initiated which automatically update `dist`
  if relevant changes are conducted in the `src` folder. The
  browser is then notified to reload the page. The serve task can
  be invoked in production (--prod) or developer (--dev) mode. The
  default mode is production. The non-secret environment variables
  for production and development can be found in `.env.prod` and
  `.env.dev` respectively. Note that the serve task only bundles the
  standalone form of respvis, as this package is the only one needed
  for the self-contained examples and omitting the bundling of the
  other packages saves much time during live development.

- The `genSVGDataURI` task converts svg files which are
  meant to be used as icons automatically to data URIs that can be
  conveniently copied and pasted into style sheets. This is especially
  helpful when creating styles for cursor icons.

The public tasks can be invoked either by directly running gulp via npx or
by running the equivalent scripts in package.json:

```
npm run clean
npx gulp clean

npm run cleanExampleDeps
npx gulp cleanExampleDeps

npm run cleanAll
npx gulp cleanAll

npm run build
npx gulp build

npm run serve-dev
npx gulp serve --dev

npm run serve-prod
npx gulp serve --prod

npm run genSVGDataURI
npx gulp genSVGDataURI
```




## Live Documentation

The famous frontend workshop Storybook is used to provide extensive
documentation about RespVis. When running storybook one can conveniently
navigate through different use cases of different RespVis components. On
top of that there are many markdown files explaining the functionality of
RespVis in depth. To run Storybook one must execute:

```
npm run storybook
```

It is also possible to build static files out of the Storybook documentation.
This can be done via:

```
npm run build-storybook
```

The built static files can be deployed to a web server, which is also done
for the online documentation of RespVis.
