## Manual Deployment

There are several ways to try out a built version of
the RespVis examples:

- Copy the `dist` folder to a web server's webspace.

- Start a local web server in the `dist` folder with a command like:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
and point a web browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

- Open the `dist/index.html` file directly in a browser (make
sure your browser CORS policy [allows local file
requests](https://dev.to/dengel29/loading-local-files-in-firefox-and-chrome-m9f)).
