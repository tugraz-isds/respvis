# Deployment



## GitHub Workflow

The RespVis repository contains GitHub workflows which are executed
automatically on certain events:
- The development workflow is triggered if new commits are pushed to
  the develop branch, including merging approved pull requests.
  The workflow is responsible for deploying RespVis'
  [self-contained examples](https://respvis-dev.netlify.app/)
  and the [live documentation](https://respvis-dev-docs.netlify.app/)
  reflecting the state of the develop branch's latest commit.
- The release workflow is triggered if a new tag is pushed to
  the repository. New tags should _always_ be created on the master
  branch, as they represent versions of the repository which are also
  published as packages on npm. The workflow is responsible for deploying
  RespVis' [self-contained examples](https://respvis.netlify.app/)
  and the [live documentation](https://respvis-docs.netlify.app/)
  reflecting the state of the pushed tag's commit.


## Manual Deployment

There are several ways to try out a built version of
the RespVis examples:

- Copy the `dist` folder to a web server's webspace.

- Start a local web server in the `dist` folder with a command like:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
and point a web browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

- Open the `dist/index.html` file directly in a browser (make
sure your browser CORS policy [allows local file
requests](https://dev.to/dengel29/loading-local-files-in-firefox-and-chrome-m9f)).
