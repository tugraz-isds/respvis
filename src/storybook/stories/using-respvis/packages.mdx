<Meta title='Using RespVis/Packages'/>

# Packages

The RespVis library is a mono repository and, therefore, structured into multiple
packages. Each package contains related TypeScript and CSS source code and is publicly
available on npm:

- [respvis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis): Extensive package, which contains
  the entire functionality of RespVis.
- [respvis-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-core): Contains core
  functionality of RespVis which is always necessary when creating a visualization
  with RespVis. It also includes the layouter mechanism.
- [respvis-tooltip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-tooltip): Contains the functionality
  to create tooltip components.
- [respvis-cartesian](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-cartesian): Contains the
  functionality to create cartesian components.
- [respvis-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-bar): Contains the functionality
  to create bar components.
- [respvis-point](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-point): Contains the functionality
  to create point components.
- [respvis-line](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-line): Contains the functionality
  to create line components.
- [respvis-parcoord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis-parcoord): Contains the
  functionality to create parallel coordinates components.



## Package Structure

All packages share the same structure:

<Source code={packageStructure} language={"text"}/>

The interesting part, as a library consumer, is the package.json
and the structure of the generated package because this is what is
provided by npm at the end of the day.



### JavaScript Bundles and Type Information

The generated package contains two subdirectories:

- dependency-based: This folder contains only bundles which solely contain
  code and type information of the corresponding RespVis package and nothing
  else. Therefore, when importing a code from the dependency-based folder,
  one must make sure to install the peer dependencies of the package too. As
  stated by the npm docs, as of npm v7 peer dependencies are automatically installed.
- standalone: This folder contains only bundles which have all necessary dependencies
  included. It is not necessary to worry about peer-dependencies when importing from
  a standalone bundle. On the contrary, such bundles are substantially larger than
  their dependency-based counter-parts. Note that, if using standalone bundles, it is
  necessary to include the styles from the respvis-package!


In addition to creating and grouping bundles, according to their dependency type, they
are created and grouped in three formats too:

- esm: The standard module system used by modern browsers.
- cjs: The module system which was and is still used in Node.js systems.
- iife: Provides a way to directly include a library in a script tag.

While esm is the de facto standard nowadays, the cjs and iife bundles are included in
the package for backward compatibility reasons. When importing from a package, the
package.json acts as a resolver. By default, it resolves to the dependency-based bundle
using the esm system.



### CSS in Generated Packages

Each generated package comes with additional styles, which must be included
together with the JavaSript module to achieve a proper layout of charts. The
styles are provided as single CSS files with the name \<package-name\>.css.



## Importing Packages without Bundler or Module Loader

Since 2023 it is possible to import modules natively in the browser via importmaps.
The following script ensures working imports between dependency-based RespVis modules
when included in browsers without bundlers or module loaders:

<Source code={importMap} language={"html"}/>



## Package Dependencies

The following illustration shows the internal dependencies between RespVis packages:

<SVGLoader rawSvg={`${PackageDependencies}`} className={'svg-loader--illustration'}/>

As can be seen, all packages are dependent on repvis-core as it provides fundamental
functionality.
The packages respvis-bar, respvis-point and respvis-line are dependent
on respvis-cartesian since it provides the base functionality for creating series and
charts defined by having two dimensions for values and scales.
The respvis-line package is dependent on respvis-point. This avoids the duplication
of similar render functions, as a line series can be seen as points connected by many
line fragments.
The respvis-parcoord package is dependent on respvis-line, since one record of a parallel
coordinates chart is visualized as a line, connecting all existing axes.
