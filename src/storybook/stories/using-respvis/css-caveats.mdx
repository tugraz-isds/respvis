# CSS Caveats

This article describes typical problems that can occur when styling
components created with RespVis.



## Using Container Queries

Size Container Queries are a useful tool for conditionally applying
styles if the size of a container changes. The usage of Size Container
Queries from the outside of an SVG will work without problems. For the
following code snippet to work properly, **_#chart-wrapper_** must either
be the id of a parent element of the chart **_OR_** id of the chart SVG
element itself ✅ :

<Source code={`
#chart-wrapper {
  width: calc(100% - 1.5rem);
  container-type: inline-size;
  @container (width < 30rem) {
    .legend {
      display: none;
    }
  }
}`} language={'css'}/>

However, using Size Container Queries inside SVGs will have no effect ❌ :

<Source code={`
#chart-wrapper {
  svg .legend {
    container-type: inline-size;
    @container (width < 30rem) {
    text {
      color: green;
    }
  }
}`} language={'css'}/>

Using Size Container Queries on the replicated HTML tree to change
elements of the SVG tree will not have any effect either. The reason for
this is that Container Queries can only be used to manipulate styles
of elements *inside* of queried containers. Since the replicated HTML
tree does not contain the SVG tree, it stays unaffected ❌ :

<Source code={`
#chart-wrapper {
  div.legend {
    container-type: inline-size;
    @container (width < 30rem) {
    text {
      color: green;
    }
  }
}`} language={'css'}/>



## Using Layout Breakpoints

Layout breakpoints are a built-in feature of RespVis. When using
layout breakpoints, one must take into account two things:
- The values of layout breakpoints are, in CSS, only available to their corresponding
  chart (window-rv class) and their child elements. However, the current value
  can normally be queried from outside via JavaScript.
- Layout breakpoints need Style Container Queries to really be useful. Despite
  growing support, one major browser (Firefox) is yet not supporting them.



## Laying out SVG \<text\> Elements

Laying out \<text\> elements via the RespVis layout mechanism is not
an easy topic and has its own dedicated [article](?path=/docs/svg-text-in-respvis--docs).
This section only aims to emphasize that rotations are (yet) not possible
with layed out text elements without alignment issues. Exceptions to
the rule are text elements which are rotated by 90° or -90°. These
elements can be rotated and will still align with their corresponding
layout element if styled with the correct CSS code:

<Source code={`
text {
  --orientation: vertical;
  transform-box: fill-box;
  transform-origin: center;
  transform: rotate(-90deg);
}`} language={"css"}/>

Note that the specification of the orientation CSS variable is crucial
hereby. Otherwise, the layout mechanism of RespVis will treat the element
as horizontally oriented.
