# About Chart Stories

Stories about the creation of whole charts via RespVis are categorized in three groups:

- Basic Examples: Basic examples showcase how charts can be created via RespVis without caring
about additional input parameters to create charts with advanced interaction possibilities
and responsiveness.
- Simple Examples: Simple examples include the base functionality from basic examples and additionally
showcase one further functionality which can be achieved by modifying the input parameters and/or modifying
the used CSS code.
- Fully Responsive Examples: Fully responsive examples not only include the base functionality of
basic examples but also demonstrate further possibilities to improve rendered visualizations such they
become fit to be used on any device.

Each component has a dedicated documentation page. This page contains information about each
demonstrated story:
- A canvas showcasing a live demonstration of the visualization.
- A button to show/hide the necessary JavaScript code for creating the visualization.
- A button to show/hide the necessary CSS code for styling the visualization.
- A button to show/hide documented arguments passed to the live visualization.
