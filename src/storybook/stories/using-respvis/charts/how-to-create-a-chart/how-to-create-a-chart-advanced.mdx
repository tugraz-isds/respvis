# How to create a Chart (Advanced Setup with NPM)

## Getting Started

This guide is intended for people who know and want to use the
advantages of the Node.js ecosystem. It is a guide for people who
want to work with RespVis using Node.js, npm or any other package
manager, bundling tools like Parcel, and Typescript.

Before starting with the implementation guide, a few words about
the best development conditions. RespVis is fully typed and can
be used the best when imported in TypeScript files. By using an
IDE of choice, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
[Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), one will get useful
hints about which arguments are expected when creating a new chart.
Using a bundler like webpack, rollup or parcel will additionally
ease the usage of TypeScript with plain HTML.

This tutorial expects the project to be set up with parcel, the
zero configuration build tool. The tutorial will begin from scratch
and explains how to progressively add functionally to achieve a fully
responsive line chart. First, all files and directories must be created.
This can be done by simply using a file manager or command line interface.
Before continuing with the next section, one must create the following files
and directories:

<Source code={tutorialFileStructure} language={"text"}/>

This can be achieved by first creating a new project:

```
# Create root directory of line-chart project
mkdir line-chart
cd line-chart

# Initialize npm project
npm init -y

# Install Parcel as a development dependency
npm install --save-dev parcel


```

Next, a chart directory with all necessary files is created. These files will
contain the code to render the finished chart at the end of this tutorial:
```
# In line-chart directory

# Create chart directory
mkdir chart
cd chart

#Create HTML file
touch line-chart.html

#Create CSS file
touch line-chart.css

#Create TypeScript file
touch line-chart.ts
```
The last thing to do before beginning to create a chart is to
install the necessary RespVis packages: `npm install respvis`.
This will install the extensive RespVis package containing
the full functionality of the library.
If one wants to only install required sub
packages, one can find further information in the
[packages guide](?path=/docs/using-respvis-packages--docs).

When running `npx parcel ./chart/line-chart.html` from the root directory one will
see the fruits of him/her work already.



## Implementing a basic Line Chart

After completing the setup, one can finally begin with the real implementation.
The first implementation step is to write the necessary markup to `line-chart.html`:

<Source code={`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Line Chart</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../node_modules/respvis/package/respvis.css"/>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./line-chart.css"/>
</head>
<body>

<div id="chart"> </div>

<script type="module">
  import {createLineChart} from "./line-chart.ts";
  createLineChart('#chart')
</script>

</body>
</html>

`} language={"html"}/>

The above markup:
1. includes `respvis.css` which is provided by RespVis and is located in
   `node_modules`. The file contains all default styling provided by the library.
2. includes `line-chart.css`, a local CSS file for customizing the appearance of
   the line chart.
3. defines an empty `<div>` element which will serve as chart-container.
4. imports and executes the function to render a line chart from `line-chart.ts`,
   a TypeScript module. The function expects the selector of
   the chart-container element as the only argument.

For the above markup to function properly it is necessary to
implement `line-chart.ts`. The LineChartUserArgs type helps
in figuring out which arguments are required:

<Source code={`
import { LineChart, LineChartUserArgs, formatWithDecimalZero, select, format, timeFormat, timeYear } from 'respvis';

//  Data Source: Studierendenstatistik
//  https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/studierendenstatistik.html

// Categories: Winter, Studierende, Ordentlich, gemeldet
// ordentlich gemeldet, ohne Mitbeleger, jeweils im WS

const students = [
  8291, 8785, 9203, 9766, 10245, 11211, 11681, 12105, 12323,
  12565, 12764, 13167, 13454, 13737, 13373, 13566, 13673, 13712
]

const years = [
  "2004", "2005", "2006", "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011", "2012",
  "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021"
]

export function createLineChart(selector: string) {
  const args: LineChartUserArgs = {
    series: {
      x: {
        values: years
      },
      y: {
        values: students
      }
    }
  }

  const chartWindow = select(selector).append('div')
  const chart = new LineChart(chartWindow, args)
  chart.buildChart()
}
`} language={"typescript"}/>

The above code snippet performs the following actions:
1. Importing the necessary dependencies from RespVis and D3.
2. Defining the underlying data. The source of the data is
   included in comments.
3. Defining the function for rendering the line chart:
   - First, the args object is defined. It contains the minimum number of
     properties necessary to still match the type LineChartUserArgs.
     As can be seen, passing x and y values is a minimum requirement,
     since a line chart without values would not make any sense. There
     are many optional parameters for improving appearance and responsiveness.
     These can be added later, but the above example works at least without an
     error occurring.
   - Second, the chart is created and rendered. This is achieved by first
     using the passed selector to select and append a \<div\> to the chart-wrapper
     element. The created \<div\> and args object are passed to the LineChart
     constructor which takes care of validation and returns the ready to use chart
     object. Finally, by calling `chart.buildChart()` the chart executes all necessary
     actions to render its content.

The only thing left to do to get the basic example working is
to specify the dimensions of the chart in `line-chart.css`
(fow your own example you can choose whatever dimensions fit best):

<Source code={`
#chart {
  width: 100%;
  height: 75vh;
  min-height: 25rem;
}`} language={"css"}/>

When serving the `line-chart.html` file one will see the fruits of him/her
work already:

<SourceCollapseBlockByStoryObj story={CurrentStories.Basic}/>



## Improving Basic Chart

The [basic chart](#story-basic) misses fundamental information. A chart viewer
will not be able to understand the underlying data at all. To change this,
the chart must be titled and labeled accordingly:

<Source code={`
...
const args: LineChartUserArgs = {
  series: {
    x: {
      values: years
    },
    y: {
      values: students
    }
  },
  title: 'Students Registered at TU Graz',
  subTitle: '',
  x: {
    title: 'Year',
    subTitle: '[2012 to 2021]',
  },
  y: {
    title: 'Students',
    subTitle: '[Winter Semester]',
  }
}
...
`} language={"typescript"}/>


<SourceCollapseBlockByStoryObj story={CurrentStories.Labeled}/>

The [labeled chart](#story-labeled) looks much better already.
Before continuing with adding responsive transformations, take a
look at how values are defined for the x dimension:

<Source code={`
...
const years = [
  "2004", "2005", "2006", "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011", "2012",
  "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021"
]

export function createLineChart(selector: string) {
  const args: LineChartUserArgs = {
    series: {
      x: {
        values: years
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
  ...
}
`} language={"typescript"}/>

As can be seen, the x dimension reflects time, but is given pure strings
to work with. If time or other numeric data is passed like this, RespVis
will interpret it as categorical data. This may or may not be desired.
In most cases, however, it is recommended to pass numeric data as JavaScript
number primitives and date information as JavaScript Date objects:

<Source code={`
...
const years = [
  "2004", "2005", "2006", "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011", "2012",
  "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021"
]

const yearsJsDate = years.map(year => new Date(year))

export function createLineChart(selector: string) {
  const args: LineChartUserArgs = {
    series: {
      x: {
        values: yearsJsDate
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
  ...
}
`} language={"typescript"}/>

Passing values this way will make axes formatting much easier and enables
the implementation of additional interactions which are not possible for
categories, like zooming and numeric filtering. You can directly see the change
when comparing the filter menu provided by the toolbar of the previous chart with
the menu of the current chart. You will see that the categorical filter control
elements for the year axis changed into numerical filter controls.

Using Date values changes the x-coordinate of the first point to be exactly
located at the y-axis. This is undesirable, for aesthetic reasons. Adding
padding to the draw-area by making use of the padding containers will
neutralise this effect:

<Source code={`
#chart {
  width: 100%;
  height: 75vh;
  min-height: 25rem;
  .window-rv {
    --chart-padding-left: 1rem;
  }
}`} language={"css"}/>

<SourceCollapseBlockByStoryObj story={CurrentStories.WithDateValues}/>



The [resulting chart](#story-with-date-values) looks already, although improvable, pretty decent
given that enough space is available. However, if space is getting narrower,
the appearance of the chart will suffer greatly:
- Narrowing of the width leads to chart title being cut off.
- Narrowing of the width leads to intersecting x-axis labels.
- Narrowing of the height leads to intersecting y-axis labels.
- Narrowing leads to overcrowding of data points.
- Narrowing leads to axes and titles occupying too much space.

RespVis provides several ways to deal with these issues. The
showcased solutions are, for sure, not the only ones but are
curated and well tested.

### Fixing the Chart Title

To fix the issue of a chart title being cut off on narrow spaces,
one can make use of the
[breakpoints](?path=/docs/using-respvis-arguments-chart-arguments--docs#breakpoints-argument)
and the responsive capabilities of the
[title](?path=/docs/using-respvis-arguments-chart-arguments--docs#title-argument) argument.
In addition, one can decide to move information from the title to the smaller subtitle:

<Source code={`
...
const args: LineChartUserArgs = {
  ...
  breakpoints: {
    width: {
      values: [20, 30, 50],
      unit: 'rem'
    }
  },
  title: {
    dependentOn: 'width',
    mapping: {0: 'Students', 1: 'Students TU Graz', 3: 'Students Registered at TU Graz'}
  },
  subTitle: {
    dependentOn: 'width',
    mapping: {0: 'TU Graz', 1: ''}
  }
  ...
}
...
`} language={"typescript"}/>

<SourceCollapseBlockByStoryObj story={CurrentStories.WithResponsiveTitle}/>



### Responsive Axis Ticks

To prevent axis ticks from intersecting with each other, one can thin
out and/or rotate the labels. This can be achieved by adding the following
properties to the chart arguments:

<Source code={`
...
const args: LineChartUserArgs = {
  ...
  x: {
    // Breakpoints can also be added to axes
    breakpoints: {
      width: {
        values: [10, 30, 50],
        unit: 'rem'
      }
    },
    // By using breakpoints and configureAxis one
    // can adjust the generated axis object to have
    // a desired number of ticks. In the current case,
    // each year will have a corresponding tick if
    // the axis has a width over 50rem. Otherwise,
    // only each second year will have a corresponding
    // tick.
    configureAxis: {
      dependentOn: "width",
      mapping: {
        0: (axis) => {
          axis.ticks(timeYear.every(2))
          axis.tickFormat(timeFormat('%Y'))
        },
        3: (axis) => {
          axis.ticks(timeYear.every(1))
          axis.tickFormat(timeFormat('%Y'))
        },
      }
    },
    // By using breakpoints and tickOrientation one
    // can adjust the orientation depending on the
    // current layout width. The current breakpointValues
    // can be read as: Ticks have 90° orientation
    // if breakpoint 0 is undercut, 0° orientation if
    // breakpoint 2 is exceeded and in between these breakpoints
    // the tick orientation is interpolated.
    tickOrientation: {
    dependentOn: 'width',
      breakpointValues: { 0: 90, 2: 0}
    }
  },
  y: {
    // If no breakpoints are specified, the axis will use
    // the breakpoints of the chart as reference. In the
    // current case, the labels of the y axis will be shortened
    // for the layout widths 0 and 1 of the chart using the metric
    // SI units. As soon as the chart reaches layout width 2, the
    // labels will be shown in full length, where groups of three
    // digits are separated by commas.
    configureAxis: {
      dependentOn: 'width',
      scope: 'chart',
      mapping: {0: (axis) => axis.tickFormat(formatWithDecimalZero(format('.2s'))),
        2: (axis) => axis.tickFormat(formatWithDecimalZero(format(',')))
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
...
`} language={"typescript"}/>

<SourceCollapseBlockByStoryObj story={CurrentStories.WithResponsiveAxisTicks}/>



### Removing Axes and working with Tooltips and Labels

The [current chart state](#story-with-responsive-axis-ticks) is nearly perfect.
The only thing left to do is solving the problem of the draw-area becoming too
overcrowded when space gets tiny.
One possible solution is to remove the axes and work with tooltips and labels instead:

<Source code={`
...
const userArgs: LineChartUserArgs = {
  ...
  series: {
    ...
    markerTooltipGenerator: function (_, {xValue, yValue}) {
        return \`Year: \${xValue}<br/>Students: \${format('.2f')(yValue)}\`
    },
    labels: {
      values: students.map(student => student.toString()),
      offset: 6,
      format: (bar, label) => format('.3s')(label as any)
    }
    ...
  },
  ...
}
`} language={"typescript"}/>

<Source code={`
#chart {
  width: 100%;
  height: 75vh;
  min-height: 25rem;
  .window-rv {
    --chart-padding-top: 1rem;
    --chart-padding-left: 1rem;
    container-type: inline-size;

    .draw-area {
      .label {
        display: none;
      }
    }

    @container (width < 15rem) {
      .axis {
        display: none;
      }
      .draw-area {
        .point {
          opacity: 0;
          &:first-of-type, &:last-of-type {
            opacity: 1;
          }
        }
        .label:first-of-type, .label:last-of-type {
          display: block;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`} language={"css"}/>

<SourceCollapseBlockByStoryObj story={CurrentStories.TooltipsAndLabelsInsteadOfAxes}/>

The [final result](#story-tooltips-and-labels-instead-of-axes) of this
tutorial is a fully responsive chart, capable of adapting its content
depending on varying conditions. To implement additional features and
interaction possibilities one may explore the
