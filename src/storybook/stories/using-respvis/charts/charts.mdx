# Charts

## Chart Class

The RespVis *__Chart__* class provides a convenient way of using RespVis to the fullest
effortlessly. When having the following markup code:

<Source code={`
<body>
  <div id="chart-wrapper"></div>
</body>
`} language={"html"}/>
this code can be used to create a new empty chart:
<Source code={`
const chartWrapper = document.querySelector('#chart-wrapper')
const chart = new Chart(chartWrapper, args)
chart.buildChart()
`} language={"typescript"}/>

The code above first selects the existing \<div\> element with id **_chart-wrapper_**.

Then, a new **_Chart_** instance is created by passing the selected \<div\> element and
the desired arguments to the constructor. Inside the constructor, the passed arguments
are validated. If there are serious issues with the arguments, RespVis will throw an error
indicating what the exact problem is. Remember that RespVis is best used by utilising
TypeScript to avoid such scenarios. If there are only minor issues with the arguments
RespVis will make small adjustments and then continue without throwing an error.

Finally, by calling **_Chart.buildChart()_** the chart executes all necessary actions to
render its content and become responsive. This includes:
1. Rendering the chart for the first time.
2. Executing [RespVis Layouting Mechanism](?path=/docs/respvis-layouting-mechanism--docs)
3. Setting up all necessary listeners to resize all content inside the chart if:
    - the width or height of the chart changes.
    - an interaction with the chart requires an immediate rerender (such as filtering data).
    - an interaction with the chart initiates a rerender and is not conflicting with any
      ongoing [d3 transitions](?path=/docs/handling-transitions--docs)

## Chart Layout Structure


### <a name="window-toolbar-layouter"></a> Window, Toolbar and Layouter

The layout structure of a RespVis chart is quite complex. It begins with
the **_window-rv_** element. This is the same element which is passed at
the instantiation of a chart and is expected to be an empty \<div\> element.

The **_window-rv_** element has two children, the **_toolbar_** and the
**_layouter_**. Both are, again, \<div\> elements. The toolbar provides the
viewer of a chart with interaction possibilities. The layouter, on the
other hand, serves as wrapper for two chart hierarchies: the original
hierarchy, consisting of an SVG node tree and a replicated \<div\> node tree,
containing invisible \<div\> elements.

The replicated node tree can be laid out with powerful CSS layout mechanisms
like CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. The elements of the original node tree then
adapt their size and position accordingly, making it possible to control the
size and position of elements inside an SVG by CSS layout mechanisms.


### Replicated Chart Layout

When rendering a chart via the Chart class, RespVis handles the layouting mechanisms
discussed in [the previous section](#window-toolbar-layouter) under the hood. This
means the layout of a chart can be controlled via CSS. For this reason, RespVis comes
with default styles to provide good-looking charts out of the box. If a developer desires
to change the layout in general, or via media or container queries, he or she
conveniently can do so by overriding the default CSS of RespVis. The default styles
for laying out the replicated chart node are the following:

<SVGLoader rawSvg={`${ChartLayout}`} className={'svg-loader--illustration'}/>

<Source code={`
.chart {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: auto 1fr / 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas:
      'header header'
      'padding-wrapper legend';
}`} language={'css'}/>

The chart element contains three children: **_heading_**, **_legend_** and
**_padding-wrapper_**. heading and legend are laid out in a similar way like the chart
element. The padding-wrapper, on the contrary, is more complex.


### <a name="padding-wrapper"></a> Padding-wrapper

To understand why a padding-wrapper is needed in the layout hierarchy in
the first place, one needs to understand its structure:

<SVGLoader rawSvg={`${PaddingWrapperLayout}`} className={'svg-loader--illustration'}/>

<Source code={`
  .padding-wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: auto 1fr auto / auto 1fr auto;
    grid-template-areas:
    '. padding-container--top .'
    'padding-container--left draw-area padding-container--right'
    '. padding-container--bottom .';
  }`} language={'css'}/>

The illustration above shows the layout structure of the padding-wrapper's
child elements. As can be seen, the elements are laid out via CSS Grid.

The **_draw-area_** is, in the SVG node tree, a \<g\> element containing
the graphical elements of the chart. Depending on the chart type and data it
may contain many elements which are constrained to specific locations and
sizes. There is no sense in laying out these elements via CSS techniques.
Instead, this is the point were the layouting mechanism of RespVis stops and
JavaScript and D3 take care about calculating the size and position of elements.

Since \<g\> elements are only for grouping and do not have bounds themselves,
the draw-area needs a [background](#background-elements) \<rect\> element which
has the same size and position of the draw-area layout element. The bounds of
the background element will always match with the bounds of the draw-area layout
element.

Nonetheless, since the RespVis layouting mechanism stops at the draw-area, there
may be cases of elements overflowing the bounds of the draw-area layout. Imagine
a scatterplot with labeled points. If a point is located at the edge of the
draw-area, its corresponding label may partly lie out of the draw-area bounds.
The resulting problem is that the overflowing label may intersect with elements
of the heading or the legend.

For this reason, the draw-area contains a \<clip-path\> element. It allows limiting
the visible area for the draw-area to cut off overflowing elements. This solves the
problem with overflowing content intersecting with other layout areas of the chart.
However, this comes with a new issue. If used this way, overflowing elements would
simply be cut off and become partly or completely invisible. This is where the
padding-wrapper and the **_padding-containers_** come into play.

The padding-containers reserve space in the grid for overflowing content of the
draw-area. The \<clip-path\> element of the draw-area respects the sizes of the
padding-containers too when calculating the bounds of the draw-area's visible
content. The size of the padding-containers can conveniently be controlled via
CSS variables:

<Source code={`
  .padding-container--left {
    width: var(--chart-padding-left, 0);
  }
  .padding-container--top {
    height: var(--chart-padding-top, 0);
  }
  .padding-container--right {
    width: var(--chart-padding-right, 0);
  }
  .padding-container--bottom {
    height: var(--chart-padding-bottom, 0);
  }`}/>


### Padding-wrapper for cartesian charts

The padding-wrapper for cartesian charts works the same as for other charts
but has to additionally lay out axis areas:

<SVGLoader rawSvg={`${PaddingWrapperLayoutCartesian}`} className={'svg-loader--illustration'}/>

<Source code={`
  .padding-wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: auto auto 1fr auto auto / auto auto 1fr auto auto;
    grid-template-areas:
    '. . axis-top . .'
    '. . padding-container--top . .'
    'axis-left padding-container--left draw-area padding-container--right axis-right'
    '. . padding-container--bottom . .'
    '. . axis-bottom . .';
  }`} language={'css'}/>

By changing the corresponding CSS variables, as discussed in the
[previous section](#padding-wrapper), the distance between axes and draw-area
can be influenced. On top of the padding-wrapper's standard use cases,
this may be useful to prevent elements to intersect with axes.


### <a name="background-elements"></a> Background Elements

Background elements are SVG \<rect\> elements which are ignored by the layout
mechanism. They fulfill two purposes:
1. They offer a method to register event listeners for a \<g\> element which does not
   directly have an area for interaction.
2. They can serve as reference elements to obtain current bounds information.

By passing additional information to the render function, background elements
become scalable. This is useful for elements having a small bounding box and
enables to detect interaction attempts in a wider area.
