# Layouting Mechanism

Many powerful CSS layout techniques like CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid
are not applicable in SVG-DOM. It is important to note hereby that there
are good reasons that styling works differently in HTML-DOM than it
does in SVG-DOM.

In HTML-DOM, elements are layed out according to the CSS box model.
All elements of an HTML document are represented as boxes. Additionally,
these boxes consist of defined areas, margin, border, padding and content,
which can be used for alignment. The simplification of content to such boxes
gives the possibility of applying different powerful layout modes. In
many cases, the default positioning of a fitting layout mode achieves
already appealing results.

In SVG-DOM, on the other hand, a coordinate system is used to precisely
position and shape elements. This type of layout technique makes sense
if elements have complex shapes or are constrained to specific positions and
sizes, which is certainly the case for many elements inside extensive charts.
There is no sense in laying out such elements via CSS techniques. Instead,
JavaScript and libraries like D3 should be used to take care of this task.

However, an SVG tree may consist of many elements. This leads to
situations where layouting certain parts of the tree could be tremendously
simplified by making use of the CSS box model and HTML-DOM layout modes rather
than making use of the powerful but complicated coordinate system.
Another advantage, when shifting the layout definition from internally executed
scripts to CSS, is that the layout can easily be overwritten.

For these reasons, the goal of RespVis is to allow certain parts of an
SVG to be layed out with HTML-DOM layout techniques. To make this possible,
RespVis applies a non-trivial layout mechanism under the hood. This mechanism
produces two DOM trees:
1. A tree consisting of the displayed SVG elements themselves, the
SVG-DOM tree.
2. A replication of the SVG-DOM tree. This tree contains replicated
elements of the first tree as \<div\> elements that need to be layed
out as HTML elements in the HTML-DOM, the HTML-DOM tree.


## Special Components in Layouting Process

The creation and maintaining of the HTML-DOM tree is the tricky part
of the layout mechanism. To understand the process, a certain understanding
of special components is needed:
- class **_layouter_**: The core component of RespVis' layouting process.
  It is a \<div\> element which contains both, the SVG-tree and the HTML-tree.
- class **_layout_**: All elements of the replicated HTML-DOM tree are marked
  as layout components since they have the responsibility to lay out their SVG
  twin elements.
- class **_layout-container_**: SVG elements which are desired to behave like
  HTML container elements must have the class layout-container.
- class **_layout-container-positioner_**: When SVG elements with class
  layout-container are replicated as \<div\> elements, they get an additional
  wrapper element with class layout-container-positioner. These elements are
  automatically positioned by the layouter process, such that the corresponding
  layout-container element matches with the position of its parent element by
  default.
- attribute **_data-ignore-layout_**: SVG elements which are desired to not have
  an HTML twin element but to be layed out as an ordinary SVG element. Attaching this
  attribute to an SVG element stops the creation of HTML context for all descendants
  of the element.
- attribute **_data-ignore-layout-children_**: Results in the same behavior as
  the data-ignore-layout attribute. The difference is that the element itself has
  an HTML twin and is layed out in HTML context.



## Layouting Phases

The described classes and attributes are necessary for the layout process to
function properly. The consecutive phases of layouting are:
1. Phase(Pre-phase): The first render of the SVG-DOM tree. This must happen
   before the creation of the HTML-DOM tree as the HTML-DOM tree is
   generated out of the SVG-DOM tree.
2. Phase: After the rendering of the SVG-DOM tree a call to the method
   <Tooltip text="/src/lib/core/layouter/layouter.ts">**_layouterCompute(layouterS)**_</Tooltip>
   happens. This call initiates the rendering of the HTML-DOM.
3. Phase: The root of the HTML-DOM tree is prepared. It is classified as
   **_layout-container_** since it starts the HTML layout context.
4. Phase: The rendering of the rest of the HTML-DOM tree is carried out. This
   happens by subsequently copying the levels of the existing SVG-DOM tree via
   D3 selections and data joins.

The fourth phase comes with many important checks. Once elements are encountered
that break the HTML context propagation (data-ignore attributes) the copying of
elements generally stops at that level. Exceptions to this rule are elements that
have layout-container elements as descendants. This results in elements still being
copied into the generated HTML-DOM tree when they are needed for the nested HTML
layout contexts (otherwise, the readability when selecting layout elements via css
would suffer drastically).

Nested HTML contexts logically come out of SVG contexts. Therefore, the default position
for HTML contexts should be the parent's origin of the corresponding SVG twin element.
This is achieved by inserting additional wrapper elements (layout-container-positioner) into
the HTML-DOM tree. These wrapper elements are positioned exactly at said position.


## <a name="synchronizing-bounds"></a> Synchronizing Bounds of Replicated and Original Tree

The synchronization of element bounds requires different actions for different elements:
- \<svg\>, \<rect\>: The rectangular shape of these elements allows a 1:1
  synchronization with the position and size of the corresponding layout element.
- \<circle\>, \<ellipse\>: The required presentational attributes for these elements can
  be easily calculated and set to match the corresponding layout element.
- \<text\>: The text element requires more complicated handling and, therefore, is discussed
  in [SVG Text in RespVis](?path=/docs/using-respvis-layouting-svg-text--docs).
- \<g\> and other: The default action is to make use of the transform attribute
  to synchronize position between layout and original element. With this method, only
  position but not size can be synchronized.
