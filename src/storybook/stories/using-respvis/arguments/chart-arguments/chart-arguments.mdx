# Chart Arguments

This part of the documentation explains basic arguments which operate on
chart level and can be passed to all chart types (except if stated otherwise).
The practical use of these arguments is demonstrated by the creation of an
example chart (multi line).

## BreakPoints Argument

The _**breakPoints**_ argument is a fundamental property of all chart types. It enables the user to specify the
exact location of the chart's _**layout breakpoints**_. This information can be used by certain other arguments
to control when responsive transformations should happen depending on the current layout state. The example
chart uses following breakpoints argument:

<Source code={BreakPointsArg} language={"typescript"}/>

, resulting in 3 layout breakpoints in width at:
- 25rem
- 30rem
- 50rem

and 4 _**layout widths**_ respectively:
- \<25rem
- \>=25rem & \<30rem
- \>=30rem & \<50rem
- \>= 50rem

Breakpoints are also specifiable for height. Breakpoints alone, however, won't do anything with a chart,
they are only used as means by other arguments to gain fine-grained control about when changes should happen.
The breakpoints listed above are used for the following arguments, keep that in mind.


### Nested BreakPoints

The breakPoints argument can be specified for certain subcomponents too (e.g. for axes). This enables the
creation of nested breakpoint layers if desired. For example, breakpoints might be specified for a chart as
well as for its axes. If this happens, by default, the nearest parent with breakpoints is referenced for
determining the current layout state.

Therefore, an axis argument which is depending on the current layout state will take the layout state
of the axis. If the layout state of the axis is not defined, it will refer to the axis state of the nearest parent,
which is typically the chart. The way RespVis handles the layout state can be adapted by stating
additional arguments.

## Title Argument

The title arg lets the user define the title of a chart. It can either simply be specified as
string or one can make use of the breakpoints as explained in the [breakpoints section](#breakpoints-argument).
This is also what was done in the showcase example:

<Source code={TitleArg} language={"typescript"}/>

As can be seen, the title of the chart should hold 3 different values, dependent on how wide the chart currently
is. The _**mapping**_ property provides a way to define at which layout width which title is used. As soon as the
chart width changes, the underlying algorithm checks which layout width is currently active. As discussed in
[breakpoints section](#breakpoints-argument) there are 4 layout widths, indexed as 0 to 3. We can see that our argument includes
specific values for breakpoint widths 0, 1 and 3. If the chart is currently in layout width 2 the algorithm
resolves with the value of the first _previous_ layout width which holds a valid value. So in the given case it would
resolve to the value of layout width 1, _Power Consumption (kWh)_.

To check the validity of the explanation above one simply needs to resize the window width and observe change
of the chart's title.


## SubTitle Argument

The subTitle argument works the same way the title argument works:

<Source code={SubTitleArg} language={"typescript"}/>
