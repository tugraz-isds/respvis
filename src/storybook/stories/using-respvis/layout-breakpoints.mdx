# Layout Breakpoints

For a visualization to be responsive, it must be capable of adapting its
layout and content depending on the dynamically changing, available space.
The layout dimensions, where changes begin to take effect, are called
_breakpoints_. The layout ranges, where the layout stays the same before
approaching a new breakpoint, can be called _layout widths_.

In responsive web design, breakpoints are typically defined as media or
container queries in CSS. Especially for visualizations, however, there
are times when the currently active layout width must be available in
JavaScript too. One example would be to apply shortening of tick labels
on narrower layout widths. This can hardly be done in CSS alone, but has
to be set up in JavaScript.



## Breakpoint Definition

To make layout width information accessible from both, JavaScript and CSS,
RespVis provides a novel approach to defining breakpoints.

<Source code={`
breakPoints: {
  width: {
    values: [20, 30, 50],
    unit: 'rem'
  }
},`} language={"typescript"}/>

The code snippet above can be used to define the breakpoints of a chart.
Under the hood, RespVis takes the specified values, validates them, and
defines a CSS variable for holding the layout widths. For the given example,
the following layout widths are possible:
- --layout-width: 0 (chart width \<= 20rem)
- --layout-width: 1 (chart width \> 20rem && chart width \<= 30rem)
- --layout-width: 2 (chart width \> 30rem && chart width \<= 50rem)
- --layout-width: 3 (chart width \> 50rem)

Note, that breakpoints can also be specified for height:

<Source code={`
breakPoints: {
  height: {
    values: [20, 30, 50],
    unit: 'rem'
  }
},`} language={"typescript"}/>


Since CSS variables are inherited, the current layout width is available to all
nested child elements of a chart. It is possible to set separate breakpoints for
an Axis component within a chart, overriding any chart breakpoints which otherwise
apply to nested child elements like an Axis.

For a live demonstration of how certain arguments can make use of
breakpoints, take a look at
[Chart Arguments](?path=/docs/using-respvis-arguments-chart-arguments--docs).


## Using Defined Breakpoints in CSS

For browsers which support style container
queries, the --layout-width variable can be used inside a style container query to adapt
the layout for various widths, as shown in the code snippet below.

<Source code={`
.window-rv {
  container-type: inline-size;
  @container style(--layout-width: 0) or style(--layout-width: 1) or style(--layout-width: 2) {
  .chart {
    grid-template: auto 1fr auto / 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
      'header'
      'padding-wrapper'
      'legend';
  }
}`} language={"css"}/>

This approach helps avoid bugs, since breakpoints are only defined once. At the time
of writing, Firefox does not yet support style container queries, so best practice to
support all modern web browsers currently involves hard-coding the breakpoint values within
a size container query, as shown in Listing 5.11. This approach introduces duplication of
breakpoint values and hence is more error-prone when changes are made.


## Controlling Layout Widths with CSS Variables

Another advantage of storing the current state of layout width in
CSS variables is the capability of scaling and shifting all
responsive transformations of a visualization at once. RespVis again
makes use of CSS variables to provide this feature:
<Source code={`
breakPoints: {
  width: {
    values: [20, 30, 50],
    unit: 'rem'
  }
},`} language={"typescript"}/>
<Source code={`
.window-rv {
  --layout-width-factor: 1.2;
  --layout-width-offset-factor: 0;
}`} language={"css"}/>
The first of the above listed code snippets defines breakpoints in JavaScript.
By additionally defining CSS variables, these breakpoints can be shifted from
their original positions. For the given example, following breakpoints emerge:

- Width breakpoint 0: 20rem * 1.2 + 0 = 24rem
- Width breakpoint 1: 30rem * 1.2 + 0 = 36rem
- Width breakpoint 2: 50rem * 1.2 + 0 = 60rem

JavaScript considers the adapted positions of layout breakpoints automatically.
For stylesheets to automatically consider the changes too, it is necessary to
use styled container queries like described in
