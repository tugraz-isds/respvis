# Layout Breakpoints

For a visualization to be responsive, it must be capable of adapting its
layout and content depending on the dynamically changing, available space.
The layout dimensions, where changes begin to take effect, are called
_breakpoints_. The layout ranges, where the layout stays the same before
approaching a new breakpoint, can be called _layout widths_.

In responsive web design, breakpoints are typically defined as media or
container queries in CSS. Especially for visualizations, however, there
are times when the currently active layout width must be available in
JavaScript too. One example would be to apply shortening of tick labels
on narrower layout widths. This can hardly be done in CSS alone, but has
to be set up in JavaScript.



## Breakpoint Definition

To make layout width information accessible from both, JavaScript and CSS,
RespVis provides a novel approach to defining breakpoints.

<Source code={`
breakPoints: {
  width: {
    values: [20, 30, 50],
    unit: 'rem'
  }
},`} language={"typescript"}/>

The code snippet above can be used to define the breakpoints of a chart.
Under the hood, RespVis takes the specified values, validates them, and
defines a CSS variable for holding the layout widths. For the given example,
the following layout widths are possible:
- --layout-width: 0 (chart width \<= 20rem)
- --layout-width: 1 (chart width \> 20rem && chart width \<= 30rem)
- --layout-width: 2 (chart width \> 30rem && chart width \<= 50rem)
- --layout-width: 3 (chart width \> 50rem)

Note, that breakpoints can also be specified for height:

<Source code={`
breakPoints: {
  height: {
    values: [20, 30, 50],
    unit: 'rem'
  }
},`} language={"typescript"}/>

Due to the nature of CSS variables, which are inherited, the active layout
width is accessible for all nested child elements of the chart. RespVis' layout
breakpoints may not only be defined for the whole chart, but can also be
specified for axes. If breakpoints are defined for an axis, the breakpoints of
the chart will get overridden for all nested child elements of the axis.

For a live demonstration of how certain arguments can make use of
breakpoints, take a look at
[Chart Arguments](?path=/docs/using-respvis-arguments-chart-arguments--docs).


## Using Defined Breakpoints in CSS

The way breakpoints are defined in RespVis avoids the need to specify them
a second time in CSS. Instead, one can make use of style container queries,
which allow to apply styles based on the current state of CSS variables:

<Source code={`
.window-rv {
  container-type: inline-size;
  @container style(--layout-width: 0) or style(--layout-width: 1) or style(--layout-width: 2) {
  .chart {
    grid-template: auto 1fr auto / 1fr;
    grid-template-areas:
      'header'
      'padding-wrapper'
      'legend';
  }
}`} language={"css"}/>

This way of writing container queries reduces bugs, as breakpoints
have a shared source of definition. On the contrary, style container
queries are a recent feature and still in the process of coming to
the web (Firefox and Safari do not support them yet).


## Controlling Layout Widths with CSS Variables

Another advantage of storing the current state of layout width in
CSS variables is the capability of scaling and shifting all
responsive transformations of a visualization at once. RespVis again
makes use of CSS variables to provide this feature:
<Source code={`
breakPoints: {
  width: {
    values: [20, 30, 50],
    unit: 'rem'
  }
},`} language={"typescript"}/>
<Source code={`
.window-rv {
  --layout-width-factor: 1.2;
  --layout-width-offset-factor: 0;
}`} language={"css"}/>
The first of the above listed code snippets defines breakpoints in JavaScript.
By additionally defining CSS variables, these breakpoints can be shifted from
their original positions. For the given example, following breakpoints emerge:

- Width breakpoint 0: 20rem * 1.2 + 0 = 24rem
- Width breakpoint 1: 30rem * 1.2 + 0 = 36rem
- Width breakpoint 2: 50rem * 1.2 + 0 = 60rem

JavaScript considers the adapted positions of layout breakpoints automatically.
For stylesheets to automatically consider the changes too, it is necessary to
use styled container queries like described in
