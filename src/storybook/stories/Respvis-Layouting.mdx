# Respvis Layouting Mechanism

To make it possible to apply html layout techniques like
CSS flexbox and CSS grid to layout certain svg elements,
RespVis uses a non-trivial layout mechanism. This mechanism
produces two DOM trees. The first one consists of the displayed
svg elements itself, the SVG-DOM tree. The second one models the
elements of the first tree that need to be layed out in html context,
the HTML-DOM tree.

The creation of the HTML-DOM tree is the tricky part of the layout
mechanism. It includes several steps:
TODO: explain in detail:
1. Select elements which serve as HTML parent containers.
   These elements(class: layout-container)
2. (class: layout)
3. (class: layout-ignore)
4. (class: layout-ignore-children)
