# SVG Text in RespVis

## Problem Definition


SVG text elements

SVGs can be layed out horizontally by using the text-anchor property...

SVGs can be layed out vertically by using the dominant-baseline property ,
which influences were text is exactly positioned relative to baseline...

%TODO: Explain line height issue
These properties influence the final position of an SVG text element.
Additionally, the real height of text elements is dependent on the used
font. A text element may always has a computationally height of 16px, but
the real height differs, dependent on the used font-family and characters.


## The solution


### Alignment of Layout Element and SVG Element (Horizontal Case)

%TODO: Explain Solution
To address all these problems and make it possible to properly lay out
SVG text elements exactly like their div counterpart, the dominant baseline
of the SVG text element had to be aligned with the vertical center of the
div counterpart. Additionally choosing an text-anchor property of start is
finally sufficient to give svg text elements the exact position in the center
of their div counterpart.
