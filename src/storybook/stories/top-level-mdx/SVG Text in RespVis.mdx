# SVG Text in RespVis

[RespVis Layouting](?path=/docs/respvis-layouting-mechanism--docs/#-synchronizing-bounds-of-replicated-and-original-tree)
discusses the synchronization of bounds between layout elements
and original SVG elements. This page discusses the special case
of \<text\> elements in this context.



## Problem Definition

Text elements come with additional presentational attributes for
alignment:

- text-anchor (start | middle | end): Attribute for controlling
  alignment in writing direction in relation to initial text position
  (derived from x and y attributes).
- dominant-baseline (auto | central | hanging | etc.): Attribute for
  controlling the exact position of the baseline. The baseline is an
  imaginary line where most of the characters of a text rest. The
  dominant-baseline attribute is, together with the x and y attributes,
  responsible for the alignment of text orthogonal to the writing
  direction.

These attributes are necessary to exactly position text elements
in SVG-DOM as there is no box model taking care of positioning
text automatically. One goal of RespVis' layouter mechanism is,
however, to lay out SVG \<text\> elements exactly like ordinary
text in HTML-DOM. To achieve this behavior, three conditions must
be fulfilled:

1. The center of a \<text\> element must match with the center
   of its corresponding layout element. The main problem which
   must be considered hereby is the positioning of the baseline.
   The \<text\> element's baseline position can be controlled by
   the dominant-baseline attribute, but this alone is not sufficient
   as there is no available option leading to the desired result.
   RespVis solves this problem in two steps:
   - Setting dominant-baseline to central
   - Adapting manually the position of the \<text\> element via
     JavaScript.
2. The width and height of a \<text\> element must match with
   the width and height of the bounding box of its corresponding
   layout element.
3. The text-anchor attribute of a \<text\> element must be
   set to start.

If these conditions are fulfilled, a \<text\> element will
not only behave but will also be able to be transformed like
text in HTML-DOM. Additionally, this way of positioning provides
a uniform system for layouting \<text\> elements and saves chart
developers from struggling with the different text alignment
attributes.


## Layouting Mechanism for SVG Text Elements

To achieve the conditions listed in the previous section,
RespVis conducts the following steps:
1. Width and height of the layout element are set to
width and height of the \<text\> element.
2. The layout element is positioned with CSS in HTML-DOM.
3. x any y attributes of the \<text\> element are set such
that the element's center matches exactly with the layout
element's center.
