## Restructuring

- Test removal of path aliases and working with workspace
  module resolution instead.
- Add TSLint and Prettier to enforce naming conventions.
- Have a look at color-continuous data component and update
  point series color and radii properties.
- Restructure Legend in multiple containers (size, category, color scale),
  which can be aligned independently.

## Documentation and Testing

## Bugs

- Firefox: Fast resizing of charts with many data points leads to strange error log
- Self-contained grouped bar chart example: Labels disappear partially on numeric filtering
- Parallel Coordinates Chart: Filtering Axes troubles Axes Drag & Drop. To Reproduce:
  - Go to Self contained examples parcoord.
  - Disable Price and Horsepower Axes.
  - Drag & Drop Fuel Axis to Start of Chart.
  - Activate Price and Horsepower Axes again.
  - Fuel Axis can't be drag and dropped anymore. Instead, mileage axis is drag & dropped.
- Linear Filtering and Enter Exit Transitions are Conflicting. To reproduce do fast linear filtering
  in multi-line chart.
- Parallel Coordinates Chart: Line CSS Transition not enabled.
- Layouting: A rapid change of the chart size, like opening dev tools, does not lead to rerender
  sometimes.
- Line Chart: Double Range Slider colored range wrong.



## Notes

- Importing and using functions in respvis-core from respvis-cartesian
  leads to error(Undefined CartesianResponsiveState constructor). Maybe
  this is inavoidable due to the multi package structure and problems must
  be solved with union types instead. Anyway, this problem does not affect
  library users, since everything works fine when importing from outside of
  respvis packages.
