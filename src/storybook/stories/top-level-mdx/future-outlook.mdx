## Bugs

- Firefox: Fast resizing of charts with many data points leads to strange error log
- Self-contained grouped bar chart example: Labels disappear partially on numeric filtering
- Parallel Coordinates Chart: Filtering Axes troubles Axes Drag & Drop. To Reproduce:
  - Go to Self contained examples parcoord.
  - Disable Price and Horsepower Axes.
  - Drag & Drop Fuel Axis to Start of Chart.
  - Activate Price and Horsepower Axes again.
  - Fuel Axis can't be drag and dropped anymore. Instead, mileage axis is drag & dropped.
- Parallel Coordinates Chart: Dragging Numeric Axes slightly changes scale. This leads to
  a lot of lines disappearing. Dragging same Axis slighly again recovers old axis scale.
- Parallel Coordinates Chart: Line CSS Transition not enabled.
- Layouting: A rapid change of the chart size, like opening dev tools, does not lead to rerender
  sometimes.
- Download: Rotated Axis Text looks different in downloaded chart svg
