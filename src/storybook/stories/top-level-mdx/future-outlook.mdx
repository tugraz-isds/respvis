# Future Outlook



## Features

- Add CSS Variables to allow controlling the duration of D3
  Transitions.
- Change Movable Cross Tool to Select Tooltip Type Tool.
  Use Movable Cross as tool option.
- For Inspect Tool + Cartesian Chart: Add Horizontal and Vertical Lines, connecting cross cursor with axes.
- Setting for toggling between category and sequential colors.
- Find a way for easily changing underlying data of charts for different space requirements.
- Add defaults for clamping css vars of chart title, subtitle, labels.
- Add possibility for multiple series categories.
- Explore options for toolbar menu on mobile devices. (Maybe slide vertically instead of horizontally?)
- Add dowload option to remove interaction elements.

## Restructuring

- Test removal of path aliases and working with workspace
  module resolution instead.
- Add TSLint and Prettier to enforce naming conventions.
  point series color and radii properties.
- Restructure Legend in multiple containers (size, category, color scale),
  which can be aligned independently.
- Add required responsive title to scaled values of all kinds.
  Add optional callback for axis titles which is by default this responsive value.

## Documentation and Testing

- Add Guidelines for changing storybook documentation
- Change Docs favicon from Storybook to RespVis logo
- Document Chart Examples Properly
- Document arguments for: flipping, zooming, legend, labels, grid, categories
- Document: scaled values, radius (scatterplot)
- Packages Page is missing respvis-parcoord package.



## Bugs

- Firefox: Fast resizing of charts with many data points leads to strange error log
  (does not appear in safe mode, probably because of an extension?)
- Rapid linear filtering needs additional update or points can be lost. Reproduce in multi-line chart.
- Layouting: A rapid change of the chart size, like opening dev tools, does not lead to rerender
  sometimes (changed 2nd resize rerender delay, watch if the problem is gone).
- Parcoord: When flipping in zoom state
- Parcoord: On mobile devices: Inversion Arrow is displayed vertically and at wrong location (only chrome, not firefox).
- Parcoord: On mobile devices: Filter Element Interactions do not work properly. Maybe remove for mobile devices,
  since the same can be achieved with filter menu?
- Bar Charts at Initial Render: For e.g. grouped bar chart there is a quick flicker at the first render before
  transitioning to the desired appearance.


## Notes

- Importing and using functions in respvis-core from respvis-cartesian
  leads to error(Undefined CartesianResponsiveState constructor). Maybe
  this is inavoidable due to the multi package structure and problems must
  be solved with union types instead. Anyway, this problem does not affect
  library users, since everything works fine when importing from outside of
  respvis packages.
