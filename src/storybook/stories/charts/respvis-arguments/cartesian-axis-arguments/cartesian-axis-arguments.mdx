# Cartesian Axis Arguments

This part of the documentation explains arguments which operate on axis level
and can be passed to all *_cartesian_* chart types. Only arguments which are
specific to cartesian axes are discussed here, for base axis arguments see
[Axis Arguments](?path=/docs/charts-respvis-arguments-axis-arguments--docs)
The practical usage of the arguments is demonstrated by the creation of an
example multi line chart. Below one can see the arguments passed for the creation
of x- and y-axis of the chart:

## Horizontal Layout and Vertical Layout

The *_horizontalLayout_* and *_verticalLayout_* arguments provide the possibility
to position axes as desired. They are also available for base
[Axis Arguments](?path=/docs/charts-respvis-arguments-axis-arguments--docs) but
really come to the fore when being applied in
[Cartesian Charts](?path=/docs/charts-cartesian-charts--about-cartesian-charts).
The possible horizontal layout types are *_bottom_* or *_top_*, while the
values for vertical layout types are *_left_* or *_right_*.

By default, the x-axis is positioned horizontally (using horizontalLayout)
while the y-axis is positioned vertically (using verticalLayout). If the chart
is flipped, however, the axes will behave in the opposite way. The example chart
demonstrates this flipping behavior perfectly well by its x-axis position being
changed from top to right and its y-axis position from left to bottom.

## Grid Line Factor

The _*gridLineFactor*_ argument is specific to cartesian charts and lays grid lines
over the chart. There are 4 possible values for the factor:
- undefined, which results in no lines.
- \<1, which results in the space between ticks to be split up according to the chosen factor.
- =1, which results in lines being exactly aligned with axis tick positions.
- \>1. In this scenario, the largest gap space between ticks is taken as reference.
  Then, beginning with the first tick position, lines are created at gridLineFactor * gap space
  as long as the calculated position is inside the chart.
