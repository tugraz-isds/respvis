# RespVis Arguments

When creating a chart with RespVis, typically all arguments needed for the creation
of the chart are passed at once as one big object at the initialization of the chart.
This object holds nested arguments which themselves may hold other nested arguments.
This part of the documentation aims to give an overview about the different types of
arguments at different levels, about their context and how to use them.
