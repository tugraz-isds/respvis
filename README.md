# RespVis: Responsive Visualisations 

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/tugraz-isds/respvis/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/respvis.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis)

RespVis, a free, open-source TypeScript library, provides multiple packages 
for building responsive visualisations. These packages include common responsive
patterns, such as rotating axis tick labels or flipping a chart to extend
vertically rather than horizontally.
The core package of RespVis provides its own layouting mechanism for SVG
chart components (title, x-axis, y-axis, legend, etc.), using standard
CSS Grid or Flexbox syntax.

Have a look at the [latest release](https://github.com/tugraz-isds/respvis/releases/latest) of
RespVis which holds a package.zip, containing the latest standalone version of the library in ES 
format.


## Getting Started

For learning how RespVis can be used to create responsive visualisations,
have a look at our tutorials:
- The [tutorial for creating RespVis viusalizations](https://respvis-docs.netlify.app/?path=/docs/using-respvis-charts-how-to-create-a-chart--docs) 
  is a good starting point if you have never used RespVis before.
- The extensive [library usage guide](https://respvis-docs.netlify.app/?path=/docs/using-respvis-using-respvis--docs) 
  covers everything which is important when creating visualizations with RespVis.
