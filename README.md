# RespVis: Responsive Visualisations 

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/tugraz-isds/respvis/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/respvis.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/respvis)

RespVis, a free, open-source TypeScript library, provides multiple packages 
for building responsive visualisations. These packages include common responsive
patterns, such as rotating axis tick labels or flipping a chart to extend
vertically rather than horizontally.
The core package of RespVis provides its own layouting mechanism for SVG
chart components (title, x-axis, y-axis, legend, etc.), using standard
CSS Grid or Flexbox syntax.
